# YDLidar GS2 Python

# WARNING: THIS STILL NEEDS TESTING WITH REGARDS TO THE DATA ANALYSIS OF THE LIDAR
 Python Class for interfacing with YDLidar GS2 + a point cloud preview  

## TODO

- [ ] - Complete the GS2 Lidar Class
- [ ] - Implement 2D point cloud viewer
  
## Project Motivation

Personally i'm not a fan of the manufactures SDK (for a few reasons which I won't be adding here) and I tend to some of my projects in Python, especially my ROS based projects, as it tends to be fast to prototype in for me.
However YDLidar don't offer any form of a Python SDK so I made this one for myself (and anyone else that wants to use it)
